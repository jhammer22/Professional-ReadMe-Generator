# Professional-ReadMe-Generator


## User Story

This app was created as Project  09 for the MERN Stack bootcamp at UTA. This unit started the N in our stack for us using Node.js to create a backend terminal command app. Using Inquirer the user is asked a series of questions we then take the user input and create a professional ReadMe.
